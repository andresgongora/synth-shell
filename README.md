**synth-shell**  improves your terminal experience and productivity through a 
combination of small bash scripts.


- **System status report**:
  - Automatically printed in new terminal sessions (local, SSH, ...).
  - Monitor your servers, RaspberryPis, and workstations. All system info you
    need at a glance (e.g. external IP address, CPU temperature, etc.).
  - Detect broken services or CPU hogs.
  - Print your own ASCII logo every time you log in.

- **Fancy bash prompt**:
  - Configurable colors and aesthetics.
  - Git statuses (requires pull/push, is dirty, etc.) if inside a directory that
    is part of a git repository.
  - Better separation between user input and command outputs.

- **better ls**: an `ls -la` on steroids alternative.
  
- **alias**: add colors and a nicer behaviour to basic commands.
  - `grep`.
  - `pacman`.
  - `tree`.
  - `dmesg`.
  - `free`.
  - `sudo`: autocomplete commands.
  - `history`: nicer format and no duplicate (consecutively the same) commands.
  

![Example with status.sh and fancy-bash-prompt.sh](doc/screenshot.png)


All features are optional, and most can also be customized to your liking.
Once installed, the scripts are called from within your `.bashrc` file and
become part of the bash session. You can find more details and similar 
tools on [Yet Another Linux'n Electronics Blog](https://yalneb.blogspot.com/).

#                                     Setup
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->

### Automatic setup

The included [setup script](setup.sh) will guide you step by step through the
process and let you choose what features to install. During this setup, you can
choose to install synth-shell for your user only (recommended) or system-wide
(superuser privileges required). To proceed,
[open and play this link in a separate tab](https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpN91wHAr1k)
and enter the following into your terminal:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andresgongora/synth-shell.git
chmod +x synth-shell/setup.sh
cd synth-shell
./setup.sh
```

Note that for `fancy-bash-prompt.sh` you might also need to have the [power-line fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) package installed. You can install the package as follows (the exact name of the package varies from distro to distro):

* ArchLinux: `sudo pacman -S powerline-fonts`
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install fonts-powerline`

Finally, open up a new terminal and test that everything works. Sometimes,
despite power-line fonts being properly installed, the triangle separator 
for `fancy-bash-prompt.sh` (if installed) might still not show. In this case, 
make sure that your `locale` is set to UTF-8 by editing `/etc/locale.conf` file 
(select your language but in UTF-8 format) and running `sudo locale-gen`.
[More info on locale](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale).
Alternatively, try a different font in your terminal emulator. Some fonts
do not support special characters. We get the best results with
[hack-ttf](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).



### Configuration/customization
You can configure your scripts by modifying the corresponding configuration
files. You can find them, along the example configuration files, in the following directories, (depending on where you installed **synth-shell**):

* Current-user only: `~/.config/synth-shell/`
* System wide: `/etc/synth-shell/`



### Uninstallation
1. Edit `~/.bashrc` and remove the lines referring to synth-shell, usually
at the bottom of the file. If you want to temporarily disable the script, you can
just comment them by placing `#` in front.
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Remove the folder containing the script, usually in your home folder under 
`~/.config/synth-shell/`.
```
rm -r ~/.config/synth-shell/
```

#                                    Overview
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->

### status.sh
`status.sh` provides a summarized system report at a single glance every time
you open up a new terminal. If it detects that any system parameter
(e.g. CPU load, memory, etc.) is over a critical threshold, it will provide a
warning and additional information about the cause. Last but not least, it
prints a user-configurable ASCII logo to impress your crush from the library
with how awesome you are.

Feel free to customize your status report through the many available options
in `~/.config/synth-shell/status.config` (user-only install) or
`/etc/synth-shell/status.config` (system-wide install), or by replacing their
content with the examples files you can find under the same directory.

![status configuration options](doc/status_config_preview.png)



### fancy-bash-prompt.sh
Adds colors and triangular separators to your bash prompt, and if the current
working directory is part of a git repository, also git statuses and branches.
For best results, consider installing (and telling your terminal to use) 
the `hack-ttf` font alongside the powerline-fonts (the later is required for
the separators).

As for the git status info, `fancy-bash-prompt.sh` prints an additional, fourth 
separator with the name of the current branch and one of the following icons
to indicate the state of the repository (can be changed in the config file):

|          Local-Upstream          | Local branch has no changes | Local branch is dirty |
|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|            Up to date            |                             |           !           |
|     Ahead (you have to push)     |              △              |           ▲           |
|     Behind (you have to pull)    |              ▽              |           ▼           |
| Diverged (you have to pull-push) |              ○              |           ●           |



### better-ls.sh
Makes `ls` print more text, but nicely formatted. When called, `ls` will now list
all files (`-la`), sort folders first, add colors to output, and list hidden
files last after a quick separator. However, if you chose to call `ls` with your
 own parameters (e.g. `ls -l`) it will revert to the default behavior except
for color and sorting options.



### Alias

- `grep` to `grep --color=auto`.
- `pacman` to `pacman --color=auto`.
- `tree` to `tree --dirsfirst -C`.
- `dmesg` to `dmesg --color=auto --reltime --human --nopager --decode`.
- `free` to `free -mht`.
- `sudo` adds `complete -cf sudo` to auto-complete commands.
- `history` various changes.

### Git branches

There are two branches in this repository:

* **master**: this is the main branch, and thus contains fully functional 
  scripts. When you want to use the scripts as a _user_, 
  this is the branch you want to clone or download.
* **develop**: this branch contains all the new features and most recent 
  contributions. It is always _stable_, in the sense that you can use it
  without major inconveniences. 
  However, it's very prone to have undetected bugs and it might be subject to major
  unannounced changes. If you want to contribute, this is the branch 
  you should pull-request to.

#                                     About
<!--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------->

**synth-shell** started as a loose collection of (very simple) bash scripts I 
used for system maintenance. In the beginning, they were simple aids to make my 
life easier, but as I progressively got the hang out of bash, I also wanted them
to print some nice output to the terminal.

This repository was quite different at the beginning. The content of most
scripts were loose snippets from third parties that were somehow smashed 
together. They worked, but not exactly the way I wanted. So, over time I have 
rewritten most scripts from scratch, removed fluff, and teamed up with 
super-friendly and engaged [contributors](AUTHORS.md). The result is what you 
see today. I admit it, it's nothing fancy. But it was real fun working on the 
scripts.

And the name? That's quite easy. I spent most of my coding frenzy
listening to [SynthWave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave) to feel like
[Hackerman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU).
